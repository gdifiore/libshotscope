 * @brief Contains the implementation of the Simulator class.
 *
 * This file defines the Simulator class, which is responsible encapsulating
 * all the functionality of calculating the flight path of a golf ball,
 * and returning it back in a specific format.
 *
 * The GolfBallPhysicsVariables class takes a GolfBallPhysicsVariables object, GolfBalFlight object, golf ball object, and atmospheric data as input,
 * and provides methods to calculate all the required variables.
