 libshotscope - golf ball trajectory calculation

Much of the math here is based on [work done](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/trajectory-calculator-golf.html) by Prof. Alan M. Nathan at the  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I turned it into a C++ library and incorporated tests.

See `examples/`.
