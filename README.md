# libshotscope
`libshotscope` is a C++ library designed to simulate golf ball trajectories based on initial conditions like velocity, atmospheric data, and more. It provides easy-to-use functions to visualize or calculate the ballâ€™s flight path and landing point.

Much of the math here is based on [work done](http://baseball.physics.illinois.edu/trajectory-calculator-golf.html) by Prof. Alan M. Nathan at the  University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. I turned it into a C++ library and incorporated tests.
