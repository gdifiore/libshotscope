# Why/Where to use libshotscope
libshotscope implements the physics behind realistic golf ball trajectory calculations, making it versatile for a variety of applications. Whether you're working with real-world sensors or developing virtual simulations, libshotscope can help.

Use Cases:
1. **Physical Golf Sensor Integration:**
If you're working with hardware that measures initial conditions (e.g., launch angle, ball speed), libshotscope can calculate accurate flight paths and landing points, enhancing golf simulators or training setups.

2. **Golf Simulation Systems:**
For golf simulation environments, this library adds precise ball flight modeling to create a more realistic player experience. It can be used in commercial or personal golf simulators to improve trajectory accuracy.

3. **Video Games:**
Game developers can use libshotscope to simulate realistic ball behavior in virtual golf courses. Its accurate physics engine will add depth to gameplay, enabling lifelike golf ball interactions with the environment.

If you can determine initial ball and atmospheric conditions, this library is a great choice for accurate golf ball flight simulations.
